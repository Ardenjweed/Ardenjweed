### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Arden Weed, a fourth year university student currently attending University of California, Irvine and majoring in Computer Science.

#### I'm currently exploring many aspects of Computer Science to really find what specific avenue within it interests me the most. As you are reading this I am taking courses in *Aritificial Intelligence*, *System Design*, **+** **more** to broaden my view on programming. My current goal is to obtain an internship over this summer where I can both apply the skills I have learned while also getting a solid feel of what industry standard coding feels like. 

##### If you would like to get in touch feel free to connect with me on **[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arden-weed/)**, however the best place to reach me would be through my **[email](mailto:ardenjweed@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub])**!
