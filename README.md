### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Arden Weed, a fourth year university student currently attending University of California, Irvine and majoring in Computer Science.

#### I'm currently exploring many aspects of Computer Science to find what specific avenue within it interests me the most. I have taken many different courses such as courses in *Aritificial Intelligence*, *System Design*, *Computer Networking*, **+** **more** to broaden my view on programming. My current goal is to graduate with a bachelor's in Computer Science June 2026, where I can then get hired into an entry level software engineering position to apply the skills I have learned throughout university and my internships. 

##### If you would like to get in touch feel free to connect with me on **[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arden-weed/)**, however the best place to reach me would be through my **[email](mailto:ardenjweed@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub])**!
